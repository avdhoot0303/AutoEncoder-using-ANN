## AutoEncoder-using-ANN
This is a small project I worked on which shows the denoising the images, we artificially add noise to the dataset and train the model and evaluate

In this project we follow the following steps:
* Import the required libraries
* Load the Fashion_Mnist dataset from keras datasets
* Then we do some data visualization
* Then we make all the values in the array either 1 or 0
* Then we create noise_factor and apply noise to entire training and test dataset
* Further we create our sequential model and fit the model 
* Then last step we evaluate the model and predictions
